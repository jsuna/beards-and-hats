15 Jan 2016 - Initial thoughts
I want to create a simple app to help me in my grocery shopping.

Problem statement: When I meal plan I tend to pick from the same selection of meals I have had before and must generate shopping lists
for each week.  Automating this process can be a time saver.

Status: I do not know how to code at all.  Basic HTML and minimal CSS.  I am going to start with a clean slate and work on my HTML and
CSS.  Once I feel comfortable there I will move to adding Javascript.

16 Jan 2015 - Plan for the day

Status: I am going to work in HTML today.  My initial goal is to create a two column table.  The first column will be the recipe name
with a link to the recipe.  The second column will be the ingredients.  For the CSS of this table I would like the Recipe title to be
bold, each ingredient to be on a seperate line left justified.
